        <div class="para1">The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice
            in the
            17th and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
            Gras," or
            fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.

            On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of
            ground 60
            miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the
            eve of the
            festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In
            1703, the
            tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.

            In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current
            Mardi
            Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711
            through 1861.
            The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
            with an
            actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.</div>

        <div class="para2">New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated
            openly in
            New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis
            de
            Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of
            today.

            The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing
            body.
            That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
            carnival
            organizations formed in New Orleans.

            By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
            celebrate
            Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each
            event an
            exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
            invoking
            John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans
            with
            dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.

        <div class="para3">In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the
            first
            recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."

            Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
            lithographs of
            parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were always carefully
            guarded
            before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But
            beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced
            in full,
            saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and
            B.A.
            Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges
            Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.

            Mayor of New Orleans</div>
        <div class="mayorp">As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our city to experience the
            excitement of Mardi Gras!

            Mayor of New Orleans

            The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth
            Night or Kingsâ€™ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.

            Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival
            clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors
            quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"

            The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure
            Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the
            fun-filled
            day of excitement for revelers of all ages.

            New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to be at
            any
            time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your
            plans
            now to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"
            <br>
            Sincerely,
