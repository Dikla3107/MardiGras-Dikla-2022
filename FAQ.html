    <div class="fContainer">
        <button class="accordion" id="open">1) Is there an "official" Mardi Gras? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the
                claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website.
                Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do
                not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual
                parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
                organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion2" id="open">2) When does Mardi Gras start and end?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day
                (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday
                is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

        <button class="accordion3" id="open">3) What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change
                from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly
                morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
                dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want
                to bring a raincoat!</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">4) Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a
                balcony, food and a bathroom pass.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion2">5) How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we call
                it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion3">6) I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi
            Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend
                when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New
                Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer
                than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi Gras.
                Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all
                day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes and masks is a
                unique and thrilling experience.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">7) What happens if there is bad weather?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be
                severe. The local TV and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion2">8) Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who
                grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade
                because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to
                hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion3">9) What are the best ways to get around New Orleans once I've arrived?

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The best methods of <span link="experienceneworleans.com/transportation.html">transportation</span> will
                be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or
                rental car
                depending on where you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be difficult.
